>> Kyle Simpson: Well, that's what I've got for you today in our course on Node.js, Digging Into Node. I hope that you have now got a much better feeling for the kind of ins and outs of how to work your way around Node, how to integrate with the system, how to do some fun little things like child processes or store in the database, things like that.

[00:00:18]
These are all the fundamental building blocks upon which all of the libraries and frameworks that you'll work in Node will have been built on. And probably the most important of all of those is really getting a solid understanding of streams. So make sure you check out that stream handbook.

Make sure you check out the course by Substack here on Frontend Masters and really just dig into Node. It's a fun and exciting ecosystem to play with. And I don't see it going away anytime soon. So thanks for being here. I hope you've enjoyed this course.
