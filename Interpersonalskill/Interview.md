# Whiteboards

- You can focus on the bigger picture.
- You don't have the compiler. You dont need to write the entire class definition and boilerplate code.
- You get to focus on the **meaty** parts of the code. The function that the question is all about.
- Write code not **pseudocode**
- Fewer errors are better.
- Speak more and explain your thought process.

# How question are selected

- You need to know where the question are comes from since a company does not have a set or list of question for a particular interview.
- It usually **fre for all** as far as questions.

Your interviewre develop a feel for your performance by comparing you to other people. It's not about the candidate she's interviewing that week. It about all the candidate that she's ever asked this question to.

when you get a hard question isn't a bad thing. When it's harder for you, it's harder for everyone.


## Behing the scene

Interview of most campanies is the same.

### Screening Interview.

This is conducted over the phone. 
Screening interview often involves coding and algorithms questions and expectatiion are just as high as the **In-person** interview.

_ Not sure if the interview will be techical, ask your recruting coordinator what position your interviewer holds or what interviwe might cover.
  - An **Engineer** usually conduct a techinical interview**

 Many Interviews use **online syncronized documents editors** but other expect you to write code on paper and read it back over the phone.

 Some may even give you homework to solev after you hang up the phone or just ask you to email them the code you wrote.

 **You will do one or two screening interview before being brougth on-site**

**An on-site** interview you usually have **3 to 6** in-person interviews.

1. On of them is usual **over lunch**
   Lunch interview are not technical and the interviewer may not even submit the feedback. This is a good person to discuss your interest and to ask about the company culture.

Your interviewer will be mostly technical and will involve a combination of coding, algorithm, design/architecture and behavioral/experience questions.

### Not responding indicates nothing about you interview status.

- Delays can and do happen. Follow up with your recruiter if you expect a delay, but be respectful when yo do. Recruiters are just like you. They get busy and forgetful too.

#### The microsoft Interview

Microsoft want smart people. Geeks. People who are passionate about technology.

You'll will show up at microsoft in the mornign and fill out initial paper work.
You'll have a short interview with a recruiter who will give you a sample question.

You recruiter is usually there to prep you, not to grill you on techincal questions. If you get asked some basic technical questions, it may be because your recrutire wants to ease you into the interviwe so that you're less nerveous whe the **real** interview starts.

- Be nice to your recruiter.
- during the day, you'll do four or five interviews, often with two different teams. Youll meet with your microsoft interviewers in their office. This is greate time to look around and get a feel for the team culture.

Whe you complete your interview with team you might speak with a hiring manager. This is a great sign! its Likely means that you passed the interviews with a particula team it's now down to the hiring manager's decision.

You might get a decision tht day or it might be a week. After one week of no word for HR, **send a friendly email asking for astatus update**


###### What's Unique.

You'll only reach the hiring manager. If you've done well, so if you do , **that a great sign!**

### Other interviews

You might be sent a **Hackerrank coding assessent** which evaluaete your ability to write optimal algorithms and correct code.. *Most important for me**

**system design** if your applying fo a **backend role**.
