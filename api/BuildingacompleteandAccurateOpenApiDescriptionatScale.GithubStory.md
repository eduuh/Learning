#### OpenAPI Description

### constraints

Multiple versions of the Api (githu.com)
Use cases where OpenAPI can't represent the exact behaviour.
Not very flexible.

### Overlays

complexity as Api evolves
Developers concernts
Not very flexible

#### Build process

Simple for Api developers
Decoupled target description from source.

### Tradeoffs

Targets can't be modiefiedn directly
Visibility into changes harder at the source.
