# The problem statement

1. Understand your problem.
2. Plan your solutions by doing some analysis and design.
3. finally Start build it, and programming

# How do we undestand the problem?

The methodology used to come up with the **conceptual design**.

1. Start by gathering requirements to figure out what our application needs to do.
   - Flesh out the problem you're trying to solve.
2. Describe the application. Build a narrative in plain, conversation language
   for how the people will use it.
3. Identifying he most important objects, which is the starting point for
   identifying actual classes.
   - once those objects have been idetified, formally describe the interactions
     between them, undestanding each object's responsibilities.
4. Create a class diagram, which serves as the main output from the five-step
   process.
   - The class diagram is a visual representation of the classes in the
     application, and creating it is where the object oriented principles like
     inheritance and polymorphism really came into play.
